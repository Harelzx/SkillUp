refactor(booking): Reorganize to 5-step flow with unified summary

## 🎯 Overview
Reorganized booking flow from 6 steps to 5 cleaner, more logical steps.
Merged "Summary" and "Confirmation" into one, moved all payment-related
content to the Payment step.

## ✨ Changes

### UI Reorganization (5 Steps)

**Before (6 steps):**
1. Details
2. Schedule  
3. Location
4. Summary & Pricing (credits + coupon + breakdown)
5. Confirmation (terms + important info)
6. Payment (payment method selection)

**After (5 steps):**
1. Details
2. Schedule
3. Location
4. **Summary** (booking details + terms checkbox + "important to know")
5. **Payment** (credits + coupon + price breakdown + cancellation policy + payment method)

### Step 4 (BookingStep4.tsx) - Summary Only
**Moved OUT:**
- ❌ Credits toggle
- ❌ Coupon code input
- ❌ Price breakdown
- ❌ Cancellation policy

**Kept IN:**
- ✅ Booking details summary (teacher, subject, date, duration, location, notes)
- ✅ "Important to know" (expandable)
- ✅ Terms & conditions checkbox (required!)
- ✅ Security badge

**Props simplified:**
- Removed: `hourlyRate`, `availableCredits`
- Added: `errors` for validation

### Step 5 (BookingStep5.tsx) - Payment Complete
**Moved IN:**
- ✅ Credits toggle (from old Step 4)
- ✅ Coupon code (from old Step 4)
- ✅ Price breakdown (from old Step 4)
- ✅ Cancellation policy (from old Step 4)
- ✅ Payment method selection (from old Step 6)
- ✅ "Covered by credits" screen (if total == 0)

**Props enhanced:**
- Added: `teacherName`, `hourlyRate`, `availableCredits`
- Added: `selectedPaymentMethod`, `onPaymentMethodSelect`
- Exports: `PaymentMethod` type

### book-lesson.tsx Updates
- ✅ Changed from 6 steps to 5 steps
- ✅ Updated validation: Step 4 = terms, Step 5 = payment method
- ✅ Updated button text: Step 4 = "המשך לתשלום", Step 5 = "סיים הזמנה"/"אשר ושלם"
- ✅ Removed Step 6 logic
- ✅ Simplified renderStep cases
- ✅ Step indicator: "שלב X מתוך 5"

## 🧹 Cleanup

### Deleted:
- `src/components/booking/PaymentMethodSelection.tsx` (standalone)
- Old versions of Step4 & Step5 (replaced)

### Code removed:
- Step 6 validation logic
- Step 6 render case
- Unused imports

## 🎨 UX Improvements

### Cleaner Summary (Step 4):
- Focus on **what** you're booking
- No distraction with payment details
- Terms prominent and required
- "Important info" expandable (optional read)

### Consolidated Payment (Step 5):
- All money-related content in one place
- See price impact in real-time (credits/coupon)
- Payment method with visual feedback
- Cancellation policy easily accessible

### Logical Flow:
```
Details → When → Where → Confirm details → Pay
```
More intuitive than splitting summary/confirmation/payment!

## 🔐 Security & Validation

### Step 4 Validation:
- ✅ Must check terms checkbox
- ❌ Cannot proceed without agreement
- Shows error: "יש להסכים לתנאי השימוש"

### Step 5 Validation:
- ✅ Must select payment method (if amount_to_pay > 0)
- ✅ Auto-skip if covered by credits (amount_to_pay == 0)
- Shows error: "נא לבחור אמצעי תשלום"

## ♿ Accessibility

### Improvements:
- ✅ Checkbox role for terms (Step 4)
- ✅ Radio group for payment methods (Step 5)
- ✅ Accessibility labels on all interactive elements
- ✅ minHeight 48-72px (tap targets > 44px)
- ✅ Focus visible states
- ✅ Screen reader friendly

## 🌐 RTL Support

- ✅ All layouts: `flexDirection: 'row-reverse'`
- ✅ Text alignment: `textAlign: 'right'`
- ✅ Icons positioned correctly (marginLeft/Right)
- ✅ Works perfectly in Hebrew interface

## 📱 Responsive

- ✅ ScrollView on both steps
- ✅ Padding bottom for safe area
- ✅ Expandable sections don't overflow
- ✅ Works on all screen sizes
